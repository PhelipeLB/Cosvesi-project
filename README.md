CRUD Beer is an open source project carried out by me @PhelipeLB with mentorship from @daniloab.

The project is opensource for those who want to learn how to code a real project into a routine with:
- discussion
- prototyping
- architecture
- drawing
- code

## How it works
The project is defined by GitHub's own issues. Each issue will have a purpose and sub issues for the same.

Each person should always be on a different issue to avoid conflicts when coding.

## How to contribute
To contribute the steps are simple:

### Discord
To make it easier, you can request access to the @daniloab discord and access the specific channel for the project.

Open an issue on the repository asking for access to it. We do not have public access due to bots.

### Issues
When entering the discord you will be introduced to the project routine. You will understand the purposes of the issues and be able to identify one that makes sense to you and start developing it.

### Contributing
To contribute, you will always need to follow these steps:
- code your solution
- create a new branch following commitlint standards
- commit on branch following commitlint standards.
- go up and open a new pull request for the team to review

#### Contributing as part of the team
If you want to contribute by being part of the team, do the steps above and request the same via discord. Afterwards, just clone the project and contribute.

#### Contribution via fork
If you don't want to follow the steps above you can fork the project and contribute like any other opensource project.

### Doubts
Any questions can be addressed via issue or directly on the discord channel
